This distribution contains FlashFloppy custom firmware for Gotek and
Gotek-compatible hardware.

FlashFloppy documentation and downloads:

Supported Microcontrollers
--------------------------
FlashFloppy supports two types of STM32-like microcontroller:
 STM32F105 (and the compatible AT32F415)
   - 72MHz Cortex-M3, 128kB Flash, 64kB RAM (AT32F415: 32kB RAM)
 AT32F435
   - 288MHz Cortex-M4, 256kB Flash, 384kB RAM

If you want to know which type of MCU you have, you can open your Gotek and
read the writing on the square chip on your Gotek PCB.

Firmware Programming
--------------------
If programming a factory-fresh Gotek running factory firmware, you will need
to program a HEX or DFU firmware file as explained in the wiki, linked above.
These files are located in the hex/ and dfu/ folders respectively, and you
must use the correct file for your microcontroller:
 STM32F105, AT32F415
   - Use file "dfu/flashfloppy-at415-st105-<ver>.dfu" (or .hex equivalent)
 AT32F435
   - Use file "dfu/flashfloppy-at435-<ver>.dfu" (or .hex equivalent)

Firmware Update
---------------
Once FlashFloppy has been flashed to a device (using a HEX or DFU file),
further updates can be made via an Update file on a USB drive, as described
in the wiki.

To support older versions of the FlashFloppy bootloader, two types of
Update file are included in the distribution, distinguishable by name:
 FF_Gotek-*.upd: Legacy Update file
    - All STM32F105/AT32F415 devices
 flashfloppy-*.upd: Universal Update file
    - All AT32F435 devices
    - STM32F105/AT32F415 devices running a recent FlashFloppy bootloader

Each update format will only work with a device (and FlashFloppy bootloader)
that supports it. If you are unsure which to use, it is okay to copy both
Update file types to your USB drive: the bootloader will correctly load just
one of the Update file types that it supports.

Alternatively try one Update file at a time, and switch to the other type if
you see error E01 on the Gotek display.

Alternative Firmwares
---------------------
In the alt/ folder you will find (pairs of) Update files implementing
alternative firmwares. Most users can ignore these, and use only the
Update files in the root of the distribution.

The alternative firmwares include:
 * alt/bootloader: Updates your Gotek bootloader
   - WARNING: Proceed with caution. Read the Firmware Update page on the wiki.
 * alt/io-test: Test your Gotek I/O pins if you suspect a hardware fault
 * alt/quickdisk: QuickDisk emulation (see the wiki)
   - If you don't know what QuickDisk is, you don't need this firmware.
 * alt/logfile: Firmware with debug logging to FFLOG.TXT on the USB drive
   - Useful only for fault finding. Not for general use.

Redistribution
--------------
Source code, and all binary releases, are freely redistributable in
any form. Please see the the COPYING file included in this
distribution.
